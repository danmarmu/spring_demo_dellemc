# Spring Boot Web Application
This repository has the project files for a spring demo that was done by EMC Consulting.  It is based off of content from a tutorial series on Spring Boot available from website at [Spring Framework Guru](https://springframework.guru)

To build this application, simply run a mvn package command.  It will run some unit tests.

It is configured to run against a hibernate database, but changing the application.properties will allow it to run against a MySQL database as well.
